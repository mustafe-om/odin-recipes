    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Butterhorn dinner rolls date all the way back to colonial times, but I've
      streamlined the process to make this recipe easier for new and
      inexperienced bakers. These classic dinner rolls are light but rich, and
      slightly sweet. They're perfect for special occasions or holiday dinners,
      alongside any main course.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>

      <li>¼ cup warm water</li>

      <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>

      <li>1 cup milk</li>

      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>

      <li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>

      <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>

      <li>1 large egg yolk</li>

      <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sprinkle yeast onto warm water. Stir gently and let sit until foamy and
        frothy, 15 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the yeast is proofing, place butter in a saucepan with milk and
        white sugar. Turn heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until
        butter melts and sugar dissolves, 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and pour into a large mixing bowl; let cool until
        just very warm to the touch and about 120 degrees F (49 degrees C), 2 to
        3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 3 cups flour, kosher salt, yeast mixture, and egg; mix gently with a
        spatula until it all comes together and forms a very thick and wet
        batter. Add remaining 3/4 cup flour and mix with your fingers,
        incorporating just the amount of flour you need, until dough comes
        together into a soft, sticky ball.
      </li>
      <li>Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic,
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
