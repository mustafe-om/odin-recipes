    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
      <li>3 â…“ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar
        in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy
        foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away
        from the sides of the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth.</li>
      <li>
        Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in
        garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled
        again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic
        in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.
      </li>
